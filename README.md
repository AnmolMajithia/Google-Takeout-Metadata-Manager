Not Deployment Ready Yet

Use this repo for conversions of majorly everything: https://github.com/mattwilson1024/google-photos-exif

My repo just acts as a helper for the same such as managing to solve the file name length limit problem (google truncates names of json files) and png to jpg converter which the above repo's code can process and some added utility like duplicate remover to remove the files already processed and only keep the files that need processing.

Code can be used in its current state but you need to apply a little logic to make it work so if you aren't a programmer or know a bit python it might be a bit tricky, I plan to make an easy to use script later but for now this is all I did.
